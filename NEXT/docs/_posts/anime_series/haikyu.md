> Whats the view like there.

- Leap of faith is a hell of a weapon
- Thats surprisingly astute

- Iron wall, I still wonder what it might look like on the other side

> There is an enormous wall in front of me blocking my way, I can only wonder whats on the other side
> , what does it look like. If I have others with me, maybe one day I will see it.

tacky
: Things that are tacky are cheap, flashy, garish, gaudy, loud, tawdry, or trashy. Tacky clothes are a fashion nightmare, and tacky comments are embarrassing for everyone involved. If you wore a bright orange suit to school, with a neon green hat, you'd be dressing in a tacky way.

- He is rentless
- That one point was worth 100
- Full team synchronized attack
- Crap, I got caught up on my train of thought
- Synchronized attack

# Season 4 - Over the Top - Part 1

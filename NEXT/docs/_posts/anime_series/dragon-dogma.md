# dragon dogma

> Dragon stole the protagonists heart

* Did you explore the hills and valleys
* Arisen and Pawn (to protect the arisen)
* Those who lurk in darkness forgets that darkness is also lurking on you
* Hydra
* Griffindor
* Dragon
* Cyclope
* Succubus - steals vitality
* You are not worthy to decide that
* Come to me, the heartless one
* You kill, what you hate

> When thou peers into the dark, the dark peers into thee
